- **Purpose**: Backend monorepo focused on authentication/identity services for Foxia. Primary deployed app is `identity-service`, built with NestJS and TypeORM, exposing auth APIs and integrating with shared `core` utilities (auth module, guards, decorators, RabbitMQ helpers, etc.).
- **Tech stack**: Node/NestJS 10 (TypeScript 5), TypeORM with PostgreSQL, Redis cache, RabbitMQ via `@golevelup/nestjs-rabbitmq`, Bull queues, gRPC clients, OpenTelemetry instrumentation, class-validator/transformer, and various shared modules under `core/`.
- **Architecture**: Monorepo managed by Nest CLI (`nest-cli.json`). Apps live under `apps/*` (identity-service is active; file-service/customer-service scaffolds exist). Shared logic sits under `core/*` (auth module, decorators, guards, entities, utils, telemetry, etc.). Build artifacts go to `dist/`. Config relies on per-app `.env` files (`apps/identity-service/.env*`).
