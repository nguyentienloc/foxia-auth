Backend: idiomatic NestJS structure (modules/controllers/services), DTOs decorated with class-validator/transformer helpers from core/, providers injected via constructor, async/await with typed interfaces. Frontend: modern React functional components with hooks, TanStack Query for async state, Zustand for session store, axios wrapper in src/core/api/http.ts configured via env vars, and Tailwind/global CSS for styling. Both sides favor strict TypeScript typing and descriptive naming.
