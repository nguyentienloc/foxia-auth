Before handing off work, ensure affected workspace (backend or frontend) compiles and passes tests: for backend run pnpm run lint/test suites when relevant plus pnpm run start:dev for smoke testing; for frontend run yarn lint and yarn test (if applicable) plus yarn dev for manual verification. Keep configs/environment files untouched unless asked and document any manual steps needed (env variables, Ory services) when describing changes.
